  <p>
    This Angular 4 Web Application styled as a brochure application was constructed by John Mulhall after his completion
    of a Springboard + course at
    <a class="people_links" href="http://www.dbs.ie/" target="_blank">Dublin Business School</a>,
    where he obtained at 1:1 Honours in the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing (Software Development).
    John's interest in Web Developmenet led him to Angular 4 where he learned how to develop applications on
    the framework after a great starter course on Angular 4 by
    <a class="people_links" href="https://coursetro.com/courses/12/Learn-Angular-4-from-Scratch" target="_blank">Coursetro</a>.
  </p>
  <h2>The Application</h2>
  <p>
    This web application as a first in Angular 4 for John is designed to show case its basic features such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Animation</li>
    <li>Reactive Forms</li>
    <li>Code/Component Resusability</li>
    <li>Shortened Development LifeCycle - Ease of Deployment</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Its content is comprised of two basic tenants, firstly some information and images about Dublin, Ireland for the
    prospective visitor. The application also has Angular 4 tips/links, which are extremely useful if you are new to
    Angular like John or moving from Angular 1/2 to Angular 4. The Application front end does not
    have any database build to house data generated from the online contact form but a backend maybe implemented
    into the future. For this version 1.0 application, the front end will <strong>not</strong> have persistent storage capability.
    There is however good responsiveness built into the front end which is tested on Chrome, Firefox and Safari
    passing tests run on the latest versions of these browsers. Also, semantic HTML5 language has been used to make the application
    more acceessible for the visually impaired. The responsiveness of the pages is indicative of the site's design focus, which is:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Brochure Styled Application Front End Design</li>
    <li>Single Page Application Architecture Utilising Angular 4's Asynchronous Features</li>
    <li>Use of Responsive Design Techniques</li>
    <li>Use of Modern Languages like <strong>HTML5, CSS3 and Typescript</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The user experience is designed to be pleasant, welcoming and coordinated for the most user friendly delivery of information per the design
    objectives for the user.
